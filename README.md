Testing serverless applications is hard. Ideally, you want to test against the real infrastrucutre and avoid mocks. e.g. a real DynamoDB table, real Lambda functions. However, the asynchronous nature of serverless makes it difficult to write tests that work and are deterministic.

This library offers a suite of tools that help solve, or at least mitigate, those issues. It is built on top of the famous [jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) library and adds new serverless-related matchers.

# Installing sls-jest

```bash
npm i sls-jest
```

# Setup Jest

Create a setup file:

```ts
// setupJest.ts
import { matchers } from 'sls-jest';

expect.extend(matchers);
```

Then use it in your [jest config file](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration) (`jest.config.ts`) under `setupFilesAfterEnv`:

```ts
setupFilesAfterEnv: ['./setupJest.ts'];
```

# Usage

## Helper functions

sls-jest comes with a set of helper functions (e.g. `dynamoDbItem()`, `vtlMappingTemplate()`). Your are required to use them in combination with the matchers that are provided. They serve several purposes:

- Validation

Jest technically allows any value in the `expect()` function, but all values can't be used with all matchers (e.g. `expect(123).toExist()` does not make sense). sls-jest uses those helper functions in order to check whether a matcher can be used with the input value you are passing. If they are not compatible, an error will be thrown.

Basic validation is also done on the values that are passed in the helper functions. e.g. with `dynamodbItem()`, the `tableName` and `key` attributes are required.

- Reuseability

Some matchers can be used with several inputs. e.g. You can do `expect(dynamodbItem(...)).toExist();` or `expect(s3Object(...)).toExist();`.

sls-jest uses those helpers to keep track of **what** you are intending to test and use the appropriate logic internally.

- First-class TypeScript support

You will get intellisense support for valid `expect` and matchers input values, and only matchers that are compatible with the specified helepr will be allowed.

- Readability

Thanks to those helpers, code becomes much easier to read and more language-natural.

e.g. `expect(dynamodbItem(...)).toExist();`

## Spies

### Setup

When using spies, sls-jest creates temporary files to deploy and keep track of some underlying infrastructure they require to function. Those files are not meant to be committed to your repository. Consider adding `.sls-jest` to your `.gitignore` file.

In order to keep track of the different stacks across different users/branches/environments, etc., you also need to specify an environment variable named `SLS_JEST_TAG` before running `jest.

```bash
export SLS_JEST_TAG my-branch
```

### Cleaning up

When you are done with your tests, you can clean up any remaining architecture and artifacts using the following command:

```bash
npx sls-jest destroy -t my-branch
```

## Utilities

`sls-jest` also comes with some handy utilities to operate common tasks.

- [DynamoDB](doc/utils/dynamodb.md)

# AWS credentials

Under the hood, `sls-jest` uses the AWS SDK for javascript. Thus, credentials are taken in order of preference as described on [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html).

- Locally on your machine

When running jest on your local machine, the simplest way is to use your shared credentials file. By default, the `default` profile is used. You can use another profile by passing it as the `AWS_PROFILE` env variable.

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=playground npx jest
```

You can also use something like [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) to automatically set the right profile for your project.

Side note: We recommend [leapp](https://www.leapp.cloud/) to manage your local credentials.

- CI/CD

When running tests in a CI/CD environment, the recommended way is to use OIDC. The assumed role must have sufficient permissions to access all the resources your test suite uses (or [creates](#spies))
