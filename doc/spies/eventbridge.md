# EventBridge

EventBridge spies work similarly to [Jest Function Spies](https://jestjs.io/docs/mock-function-api). They let you spy on a specific EventBridge bus to test if events have been placed into it.

## How it works

Under the hood, EventBridge spies need to subscribe to an EventBridge bus in order to grab all the events that were put into it. It then keeps track of them and you can later assert on them. To do so, it deploys either an SQS queue or a CloudWatch log group (depending on the [configuration](#the-eventbridgespy-helper-function)) and subscribes it to the bus you are spying on. Spies can then use them to collect all the events from the bus and make them available to [matchers](../matchers/eventbridge.md) later.

## The `eventBridgeSpy()` helper function

This helper creates a new spy for a given event bus. Parameters:

- `adapter`: `sqs` or `cw`. Specified how you would like the spy to subscribe to the bus. See [SQS vs CloudWatch](#sqs-vs-cloudwatch). Defaults to `sqs`.
- `eventBusName`: The bus name you are spying on.
- `config`: configuration for the Spy adapter (see below)

Config:

- `matcherDefaultTimeout`: The default timeout for event matchers, in milliseconds. Defaults to `10_000`. This is the maximum time a matcher will wait until it determines whether the assertion succeeds or fails. Also see the [recommendations](#recommendations) below about timeouts.

**with the sqs adapter**:

- `waitTimeSeconds`: number, optional: The maximum polling time of the sqs poller (uses long polling). Defaults to `20`. Must be between `0` (use short polling) and `20`. The spie will run long polling cycles until the spy is [stopped](#spy.stop)
- `clientConfig`: [SQSClientConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-sqs/interfaces/sqsclientconfig.html), optional. Custom AWS SDK config.

**with the cloudwatch adapter**:

- `interval`: number, optional: The interval at which the spy will pull logs from the log group. Defaults to `2000`
- `clientConfig`: [CloudWatchLogsClientConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-cloudwatch-logs/interfaces/cloudwatchlogsclientconfig.html), optional. Custom AWS SDK config.

## Usage

The simplest and most efficient way to use EventBridge spies is to create them at the very beginning of your tests. i.e.: in a `beforeAll()` hook at the top of your file or a `describe` block. The first time you create a spy for a given configuration combination (`adapter` and `eventBusName`), a new CloudFormation stack will be deployed automatically with the necessary resources. Further usage of the same spy will re-use the already deployed resources, even across several files.

```typescript
let spy: EventBridgeSpy;

beforeAll(async () => {
  // create a spy. This will also deploy the required infrastructure, if need be.
  spy = await eventBridgeSpy({
    eventBusName: 'my-bus',
  });
});

afterEach(() => {
  // clean up all events in memory between each test.
  spy.reset();
});

afterAll(async () => {
  // stop spying on the bus.
  await spy.stop();
});

it('should have an event matching an object', async () => {
  const order = {
    id: crypto.randomUUID(),
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  };

  // Put an event into the bus
  await client.send(
    new PutEventsCommand({
      Entries: [
        {
          EventBusName: 'default',
          DetailType: 'orderCreated',
          Source: 'sls-jest',
          Detail: JSON.stringify(order),
        },
      ],
    }),
  );

  // check that the event was seen on the bus
  await expect(spy).toHaveEventMatchingObject({
    'detail-type': 'orderCreated',
    detail: {
      id: order.id,
    },
  });
});
```

## EventBridge Spy Reference

### `spy.reset()`

Resets the spy. All events captured so far will be cleared from the spy.

Use this helper between tests to clean up the state of the spy.

```typescript
afterEach(() => {
  spy.reset();
});
```

### `spy.stop()`

Stops the spy completely. The spy will stop capturing events from the event bus.

You SHOULD call this method at the end of each set of tests.

```typescript
afterAll(async () => {
  await spy.stop();
});
```

### `spy.destroyStack()`

Destroys the stack used by this spy.

Note: The destruction of the stack happens asynchronously.

```typescript
afterAll(async () => {
  await spy.destroyStack();
});
```

ðŸ’¡ You usually will want to RETAIN the stack. i.e. for further tests, or for re-running the same test later without having to re-deploy the stack. Consider using the [npx sls-jest destroy](setup.md#cleaning-up) CLI command when you are done testing, instead (e.g. after you merge your branch).

## SQS vs CloudWatch

Both methods have pros and cons. Based on your use case, you might consider using one or the other. Here are a few differences to take into account:

**SQS**

Pros:

- it is usually faster because events hit the queue as soon as they get on the bus. They also hit the spy quicker thanks to [long-polling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-short-and-long-polling.html).

Cons:

- Harder to debug. Spies delete the messages as soon as they are received. When debugging a failed assertion, you cannot go check later if a message was missed by the spy, or by an invalid event pattern, for example.

**CloudWatch**

Pros:

- By default, events are retained in the log group for 1 day. That allows you to go and check what events where received as you write your tests. This can help find issues or adjust [timeouts](#recommendations) for example

Cons:

- This method is slower as spies must wait until the logs are ingested by CloudWatch. Spies also do interval polling when reading them from the logs.

## Recommendations

In practice, because of the asynchronous nature of EventBridge, it is hard to control how events are collected. For example, there is a chance that events generated by a previous test (`it`) could be delayed and might interfere with the following tests. Here are some recommendations that can help mitigate this problem.

**Always use random ids and assert on them**

By using random ids and matching them in your test, you are avoiding false positive and false negative results.
For example, here is a bad test:

```typescript
it('should see an orderCreated event - use case 1', async () => {
  // test case 1
  await createOrder(...);
  await expect(spy).toHaveEventMatchingObject({
    'detail-type': 'orderCreated',
  });
});

it('should see an orderCreated event - use case 2', async () => {
  // test case 2
  await createOrder(...);
  await expect(spy).toHaveEventMatchingObject({
    'detail-type': 'orderCreated',
  });
});
```

Matching only against the `detail-type` is not specific enough. The second test might see the event from the previous one and return successfully, when in fact no event was placed in that scenario.

A better test would be:

```typescript
it('should see an orderCreated event - use case 1', async () => {
  // test case 1
  const order = await createOrder({,
    //...
  });
  await expect(spy).toHaveEventMatchingObject({
    'detail-type': 'orderCreated',
    details: {
      // assert on a specific random id
      id: order.id,
    },
  });
});

it('should see an orderCreated event - use case 2', async () => {
  // test case 2
  const order = await createOrder({
    //...
  });
  await expect(spy).toHaveEventMatchingObject({
    'detail-type': 'orderCreated',
    details: {
      // assert on a specific random id
      id: order.id,
    },
  });
});
```

**Use adequate timeouts**

When matchers evaluate an assertion, they wait up to a certain amount of time until the assertion can either be resolved, in which case the matcher returns immediately, or it times out and evaluates the assertion with the data it has at that moment. Using too short timeouts can cause false negatives or false positives as events that affect the result might arrive shortly after. On the other hand, using too-long timeouts can artificially slow down your test suite in some cases. Playing with different timeouts can reduce this inconvenience. Finding the right timeout may vary depending on your architecture and use case.

Cases where a long timeout can slow down your tests:

- `expect(spy).not.toHaveEventMatchingObject(...)`: The matcher must wait the full timeout in order to ensure the event is not seen.

- `expect(spy).toHaveEventMatchingObjectTimes(..., 2)`: The matcher must make sure that no more than 2 events are received.

In any case, as soon as the assertion can be resolved, the matcher will return immediately. e.g. the matcher expects exaclty 2 events, but sees 3.

Timeouts can be specified at the spy level, in the config (`matcherDefaultTimeout`), or case by case. Example:

```typescript
await expect(spy).not.toHaveEventMatchingObject(
  {
    'detail-type': 'orderCreated',
    detail: {
      id: order.id,
    },
  },
  {
    timeout: 15000, // 15 seconds timeout
  },
);
```
